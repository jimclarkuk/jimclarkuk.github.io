title: "Slack etiquette for chatty teams"

Many tech teams have embraced the fact that code is written once and read many times. In doing so they take care about the readibility of the code they write. This post looks at how we can apply that principle in to how we communicate with our colleages over slack (yes or Teams).

The aim is to have open team channels where it's easy to skim the different topics, but hidden depths where it's easy to get to the detail when you opt-in to a conversation.

## Public over Private - Hub and Spoke
Other than truly private conversations, anybody should be able to opt-in to any conversation. This helps the team keep up-to-speed asynchronously. To enable this we:
- Avoid using DMs or group DMs
- Use the public team channel as a hub where conversations start
- Simple conversations are **always** threaded
- Complex conversations are taken to a [dash channel](https://hopiin.slack.com/apps/AG3KAJ7NF-dash?tab=more_info) (short lived, time bound)
- Long running topics have a dedicated channel

## Slack is for the discussion - Jira is for the conclusion - Notion is for the context
*other tools are available*
- Anything you need an answer on, which requires discussion, start a Slack thread
- Once you have an answer think about where that answer will be needed. Typicall you might be update the **description** of a ticket that's about to be picked up
- Next think ahead... If there is relevant **context** which will be relevant in the future then capture it in **Notion** or your documentation system.
- Yes Jira has comments but these should be exclusivly to provoke the discussion, not to capture the conclusion (as no-one reads the comments)

## Don't make them click the link
 ... to understand the nature of the request
### Don't do this

When you are starting a conversation in a public channel *everyone* will have to open the link to know whether the question is aimed at them.
### Do this

Take a minute to include just enough info for folks to make a decision whether they want to follow the link.

## Don’t force people into a conversation - inform them it’s happening
We will often see a conversation that we think might be relevant to a colleague. We’ll often reply to the thread `FYI @james`.

Let's think through the impact of this?

✅ They now know about the conversation
❌ They need to read the thread to catch up - see [Make it easy for people to catch-up](TODO)
❌ Everyone following that thread gets a useless notification
❌ Others don’t know *why* that person has been included and might wait for an answer

Instead copy a link to the thread and DM them asking if they can help out.

Then their first reply in the thread can actually have value - or they can directly feedback to you why it’s not relevant to them.

### Don't make them read the thread
We've all been @Rui getting this ping at the bottom of a 100 message thread...

If you *do* tag someone to bring them into the conversation mid-way give them a summary of the conversation so far, and be explicit about why you've tagged them.
